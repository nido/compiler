 * Module: config_targ.h
 *
 * Revision history:
 *  15-Jun-91 - Original Version
 *  25-Sep-91 - Added subprogram interface pointers.
 *  27-Nov-91 - Reconfiguration of target representation for TP.
 *  21-Apr-93 - Set TARG_NEEDS_QUAD_OP to 1
 *  14-Mar-97 - Removed most -TARG group flags to config_TARG.h.
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * This file defines general configuration parameters which are
 * specific to the compiler's target machine and system.
 * There is an approximate distinction between -TARG option group
 * flags and their configuration (in config_TARG.[hc]), and more
 * generic target configuration (in this file).  Note that this file
 * is included in config.h, and hence indirectly in most source files,
 * whereas config_TARG.h is only included directly, so putting new
 * -TARG option-related variables in config_TARG.[hc] is to be
 * preferred to putting them here.
 *
 * See com/config.h for a detailed description of configuration
 * parameters, where they are declared, and how they are processed.
 *
 * See also:
 *	TARGET/com/targ_const.h -- Manipulation of target constants, as
 *		appropriate on the host system.

 * Target selection
 *
 * Note that the current target is also given by a #define name of the
 * form TARG_xxx.  However, since a single compiler may support several
 * target variants, this symbol (defined in the TDT) will generally be
 * less specific than the variable Target below.
