/* ====================================================================
 *   TCON Utilities
 *
 *   TCON utilities module supports mapping of TCONs to their
 *   symbolic names. Such mapping is necessary for the processors
 *   that do not grant a relocated access to the constant holding
 *   sections (eg. .rodata, etc.). These symbolic names are only
 *   used for lai/assembler emission purposes. It should work like
 *   so:
 *
 *     1. The CGIR OPs refer to TNs representing TCONs;
 *     2. When an OP referencing a TCON is emitted into a
 *        lai/assembly file, TCON's symbolic name is used
 *        to replace the TCON TN;
 *     3. When TCONs are emitted into the .rodata, etc.
 *        section, each TCON has a label emitted with its
 *        symbolic name.
 *
 *   NOTE: This file should only be included by the lai/expand.h
