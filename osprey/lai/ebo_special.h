 *
 *  Description:
 *  ============
 *
 *  A couple of utility routines are included here because they require machine
 *  specific code.
 *
 *    EBO_Copy_Operand
 *         An index to the copied operand is returned, if the OP can be
 *         viewed as just moving bits from one location to another, and a -1,
 *         if not.
 *
 *    EBO_Can_Merge_Into_Offset
 *         If the OP is an add, subtract, or logical or with a small
 *         immediated constant, it may be possible to move the constant
 *         into the offset field of a memory operation and use the
 *         other operand as the index.
 *
 *  Special case optimizations are performed with the other routines.
 *  This includes simple things like transforming "x+0" into "x" and
 *  more complicated patterns such as "(x+1)+1" into "x+2".
 *
 *  As a gerneral philosophy, instructions that are redundant are not
 *  removed.  New instructions are inserted after them that redefine
 *  the result TN of the optimized instruction.  It is then left to
 *  the general dead-code eliminator to remove the unneeded definition.
 *
 *  These routines will return a TRUE value if the original OP has been
 *  optimized and can be deleted, and a FALSE value if the original value
 *  must be kept in the program.
 *
 *  delete_duplicate_op
 *	This routine handles the general case when a redundant operation
 *	is recognized.
 *
 *	The first argument is a pointer to the redundant
 *	OP, and the second operand is the EBO_OP_INFO entry for the
 *	preceeding matching entry.
 *
 *  delete_subset_mem_op
 *	This routine is called to delete a load instruction that has
 *	been matched with a store instruction.  This routine handles
 *	the case where the data being loaded is a subset of the data
 *	that was stored, thus requiring shifts and masking operations.
 *
 *	The first argument is a pointer to the redundant load OP,
 *	and the second operand is the EBO_OP_INFO entry for the
 *	preceeding matching store. The thrid argument is the offset of
 *	the memory addressed by the preceeding instruction and the fourth
 *	argument is the offset used in the redundant instruction.
 *
 *  delete_reload_across_dependency
 *	This routine is called when the following sequence is found:
 *		store into location x
 *		store into location y
 *		load from location x (which could ansl be location y)
 *	The routine will attempt to generate a compare of the addreses
 *	x and y, and will then select the proper value to use to replace
 *	the load from x.
 *
 *  combine_adjacent_loads
 *	This routine merges two load instructions that reference adjacent
 *	memory locations into a single paired-load instruction.
 *
 *  Resolve_Conditional_Branch
 *	This routine attempts to determine which direction a conditional
 *	branch will go when the condition can be determined at
 *	compile time.
 *
 *  Fold_Constant_Expression
 *	This routine attempts to evaluate the instruction when
 *	all the operands have been determined to be constants.
 *
 *  Constant_Operand0
 *	This routine looks for special case optimizations when the
 *	first operand of the instruction is a constant.
 *
 *  Constant_Operand1
 *	This routine looks for special case optimizations when the
 *	second operand of the instruction is a constant.
 *
 *  Special_Sequence 
 *	This routine looks for special case optimizations involving
 *	a sequence of operations.
