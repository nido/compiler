 *
 *   Module that deals with the SSA form.
 *
 *   The entire program or a region of a program can be converted to the
 *   SSA form.
 *
 *   In the case of a region, the region -- a single entry, multiple
 *   exits entity, possesses the following properties:
 *
 *     1. every node in the region is dominated by the region entry;
 *     2. since we add post-exits to the nodes through which the region
 *        may be exited, such post-exits constitute a natural border
 *        of the region with the property that every post-exit is
 *        immediately dominated by a node from the region.
 *
 *   As a result of these properties the following holds:
 *
 *   Traversing the dominator tree starting at the entry node for a region
 *   will visit all nodes within this region's border without going out of
 *   this region's limits.
 *
 *   It basically means that :
 *
 *      (1) I can start traversing the dominator tree at the entry, 
 *      (2) I will necessary encounter one of the border (post-exit) nodes
 *          before I left the region -- therefore I can stop exploring the
 *          given tree branch as soon as I see a border node,
 *      (3) No node in the region will be missed by such traversal.
 *          Indeed, if a node X is not visited then its dominator tree
 *          predecessor is not visited or is not in the region. If it is
 *          not in the region, X may not be in the region because the
 *          only way to leave the region is through the border nodes
 *          that are immediately dominated by some node in the region.
 *          If X's predecessor is in the region and is not visited, then
 *          we can repeat the explanation. But eventually nodes in the
 *          region will be exhausted, which would mean that the entry
 *          node has not been visited -- nonsence, I started with it.
 *
 *   




 *   For building the SSA form, I use the algorithm by Cytron et al.
 *   ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, vol. 13,
 *   N. 4, October 1991, pp. 451 - 490.
 *
 *   The algorithm does:
 *
 *     1. compute the dominance frontier of the nodes in the program
 *        (region),
 *     2. place the phi-functions,
 *     3. rename variables.
 *
 *   Dominance frontier computation requires the bottom-up traversal of
 *   the dominator tree. The bottom-up list of nodes is constructed as
 *   a reversal of the DFS traversal of the dominator tree of the program
 *   (region).
