# Below are defined the top level Makefile targets.
#
# Note that dependencies between modules are checked only for the
# targets: local last install
# Indeed the target default checks itself the dependencies in each
# module makefile by invoking the target first that recursively builds
# dependent modules.
# This means that parallel make (make -j 8 for instance) is only
# supported for targets: local last install
# make last is equivalent to make default with support for parallel make.
# 
# Targets list:
# default: builds the compiler w/o installing it
# local: build only local module files
# last: same as default (with support for parallel make)
# install: builds and install (with support for parallel make)
# clean: clean intermediate files
# clobber: clean all built files
# 
# Note that SUBDIRS may be redefined on the command line to rebuild
# only some modules, for instance:
# > make SUBDIRS=be install
#
# Note that NO_DEPS=1  on the command line can be used to avoid dependency
# checks between module when one know that only local modification occued:
# > make NO_DEPS=1 SUBDIRS=be install
#
# Typical build usage:
# > make install
# or for 2 steps build:
# > make default
# > make install
#
# Typical build usage for parallel make
# > make -j 8 install
# or for 2 steps build:
# > make -j 8 last
# > make -j 8 install
