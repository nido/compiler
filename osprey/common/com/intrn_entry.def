/* This file is a dummy added to ease migration to the gcc4 frontend.

   We have a mutual dependency:
     stxp70-binutils depends on the names of the files containing intrinsics
     definitions in open64, and
     open64 depends on the stxp70-binutils version

   The gcc4 frontend migration adds an extra file, intrn_info.def,  containing
   intrinsics definitions in open64, and so it is necessary to break this
   mutual dependency.

   The idea is to:
     1. Introduce a dummy intrn_info.def (this file) to the open64 trunk.
     2. Update the trunk stxp70-binutils to refer to this file.
     3. Move the open64 trunk dependency to the new stxp70-binutils trunk.
     4. Rebase the dev-gcc4-frontend branch to include this
        stxp70-binutils dependency.

   Then the gcc4 frontend branch delivery can proceed.
 */

/* With the merge of the dev-gcc4-frontend work, this file will
   centralize all the whirl intrinsic info. */
