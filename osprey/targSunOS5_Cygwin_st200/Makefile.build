# By default the build system relies on relative paths to access the
# source directories. However, it is also possible to build the
# compiler with absolute paths (for instance to build it in an other
# directory or when using symbolic links that would prevent the use of
# relative path access) ; just set one or all of the following
# variables accordingly.

# where to find the sources
# SRC_DIR        = $(HOME)/Work/PRO64/osprey1.0
# where to build
# BUILD_DIR      = /tmp/targSunOS5_Cygwin_st200
