*** Open64 Compiler Summary

The Open64 is an Open Source GCC compatible C/C++/Fortran compiler suitable mainly for 32 bits cores with high performance requirements.

The Open64 compiler is an open source project with no patent under the terms
of the GNU General Public License.
The Open64 copyright olders include Silicon Graphics and for their
contributions the Free Software Foundation, STMicroelectronics, PathScale,
 Intel Corporation, University of Alberta, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Refer to the Codex project: https://codex.cro.st.com/projects/open64
for more information.

*** Installation
To extract the compiler sources do:
svn co svn://gnx287.gnb.st.com/open64/trunk

To build and install the compiler read the INSTALL file in this directory.
This source tree only includes the compiler sources. Libraries, runtime 
support, binary utilities and other tools must be provided otherwise.
See the next section for these dependencies.

*** ST Open64 compiler dependencies

The Open64 compiler must be integrated with other components to build a full compiler toolchain. For instance:
- GNU Binary utilities for the binary level tools,
- The MCDT IFR integer arithmetic support library,
- The MCDT IFR floating point support library,
- The Cygnus Newlib libc/libm library.

Other optional components can be used for engineering or improved performance:
- The MCDT/CEA Linear Assembly Optimizer (LAO) for improved Instruction Scheduling and Software pipelining,
- The MCDT Binopt tool for link time optimizations,
- The MCDT/AST Machine Description System (MDS) or other architectural description to drive the generation of the target description into the compiler,
- The MCDT QA Validation framework for functional validation,
- The MCDT Performance Tracking System (PTS) for functional and performance tracking.


*** Original README file from SGI pro64-0.13

The following of this README file is the original README from the PRO64 SGI 0.13 version. It does not give information on the open64 port of the compiler at STMicroelectronics.

The SGI Pro64(TM) compiler suite includes optimizing compilers 
and runtime support for C, C++, and Fortran90. These compilers 
produce code that follows the Linux/IA-64 ABI.  This means that 
objects produced by the SGI compilers can link with objects 
produced  by other Linux/IA-64 compliant compilers such 
as RedHat/Cygnus gcc and g++.

The latest information and updates for the Pro64 compilers will 
eventually be found at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/Pro64. The rpm
included in this distribution represents a work in progress.  

Please send problem reports to the mailing list described on 
the SGI OSS Pro64 web site.

Language highlights:

  C compatible with gcc
  C++ compatible g++
  Fortran90 with Fortran95 extensions

Optimization highlights:

Software pipelining:  

At the -O2 and -O3 optimization levels the 
compilers will use the IA-64 software pipelining instructions.  
At the -O3 level a more powerful data dependence analysis will 
be performed.  

Scalar optimization:  

A partial list of optimizations performed include 

  Code motion
  Constant propagation 
  Dead code elimination 
  Expression simplification 
  Common subexpression elimination
  Strength reduction

Upcoming features 

  Exception handling for C++
  Interprocedural optimization
  OpenMP support in Fortran90
  OpenMP support in C and C++
  More optimizations


Installation Information

Untar the tar file that you downloaded from the ftp site:

  % cd installation_directory 
  % gunzip pro64-0.01.0-10-sources.tar.gz 
  % tar xvf pro64-0.01.0-10-sources.tar 

The pro64 compilers assume to be operating under an NUE
environment.  Information about NUE can be found at:

  http://www.software.hp.com/ia64linux

You need to install the pro64 rpm from the nue environment.
Note that the nue command will put you under your home
directory in NUE, which may not be your regular home
directory. You should move the pro64 rpm and osprey
source tree to a directory that is accessible under NUE.

To install the pro64 rpm do the following:

  %su
  #nue
  #rpm -i --force --nodeps pro64-0.01.0-10.ia64.rpm

The --nodeps flag is needed because the installation
under NUE only sees files installed under NUE. It does
not see the files installed from the NUE rpm.
                 

You can verify your installation by doing a simple
hello world test under NUE:

  %cat hello.c
  #include <stdio.h>

  main()
  {
    printf("hello world\n");
  }


  %sgicc hello.c
  %./a.out
  hello world
  %

The README.src file provides information about building the
pro64 compilers and libraries from the osprey1.0 source tree.
The sgicc(1), sgiCC(1) and sgif90(1) man pages provide information
about the SGI C, C++ and Fortran90 compiler commands.
