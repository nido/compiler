A single set of targinfo files is now generated for all
supported st2xx targets.

The targinfo for st220, st230 and st231 targets is generated
using the command:

  ./build-all.sh $PRO64/osprey1.0/targinfo/st200

This exexutes the following command:

  perl targ_gen.pl -s st231 -s st230 -s st220 -o $PRO64/osprey1.0/targinfo/st200

The order of the -s options does not matter functionally,
but it does make a difference to the order of things in
the generated files.  Therefore to minimize differences
when regenerating the files, it is best to follow the
above ordering.

To update the reference files use:

  ./build-all.sh ../ref/st200
