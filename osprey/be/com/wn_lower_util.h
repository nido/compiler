/* ====================================================================
 *
 * Module: wn_lower_util.h
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * This module provides common support functions to the lowering phases
 * invoqued by the wn_lower.h module.
 *
 * Interface:
 *
 * This interface is private to be.so it should not be exported to
 * other compiler components.
 * 
 *
 * Lowering State Support
 * ======================
 *
 * typedef CURRENT_STATE
 * CURRENT_STATE current_state
 * 
 * This type maintains information to locate a point in the lowered tree.
 * The current_state variable holds the current location while traversing the
 * whirl tree.
 * At any time during the lowering the current state can be accessed,
 * modified, saved or restored (for nesting traversals).
 * The information available from the state is:
 *   srcpos: the source position
 *   stmt: the statement that defines the location in the whirl tree
 *   function: the processed function when lowering a function
 *   actions: the applied lowering actions
 *  
 *	#define	current_srcpos		current_state.srcpos
 *	#define	current_stmt		current_state.stmt
 *	#define	current_actions		current_state.actions
 *	#define current_function	current_state.function
 *
 * Short names for accesing the current state informations.
 *
 *
 * void setCurrentState(WN *tree, LOWER_ACTIONS actions);
 * void setCurrentStateBlockFirst(WN *tree, LOWER_ACTIONS actions);
 * void setCurrentStateBlockLast(WN *tree, LOWER_ACTIONS actions);
 *
 *   these functions modify the current state to set the new actions or
 *   statement location. The two last functions set the location to
 *   the first or last statement of a block respectively. the passed tree
 *   must be a block tree.
 *
 * CURRENT_STATE pushCurrentState(WN *tree, LOWER_ACTIONS actions);
 *
 *   This function set a new state for the current state and returns the old
 *   one. It is used for nested traversals.
 *
 * void popCurrentState(CURRENT_STATE state);
 *
 *   This function reset the current state to the given state. It is used
 *   for nested traversals.
 *
 *
 * Assignment Support
 * ==================
 *
 * PREG_NUM AssignPregExprPos(WN *block, WN *tree, TY_IDX ty, SRCPOS srcpos,
 *                            LOWER_ACTIONS actions)
 *
 * PREG_NUM AssignExpr(WN *block, WN *tree, TYPE_ID type)
 *
 * PREG_NUM AssignExprTY(WN *block, WN *tree, TY_IDX ty)
 *
 *   All the above functions allocate a preg of the given type and assign
 *   expression tree to it, and attach the generated statement to the block. 
 *   For the functions where the actions are not specified, the current
 *   lowering state actions are used (see current_actions above).
 *   If specified and not null, attach srcpos to the statement.
 *   The created preg will have the name specified by the
 *   value of CurrentPregName(), see below.
 *
 *   void AssignPregName(const char *part1, const char *part2 = NULL)
 *   char *CurrentPregName()
 *   void ResetPregName(void)
 *
 *   AssignPregName() construct a name by concatenating the two arguments
 *   and set this name for the PREGs that will be allocated by the Assign...()
 *   functions above. CurrentPregName() returns the currently defined
 *   name or NULL if no name has been assigned to the preg allocation.
 *   The name can be used to allocate explicitly a PREG with Create_Preg()
 *   (defined in symtab.h).
 *   ResetPregName() resets the allocated PREGs name to NULL.
 *   If the current PREG name is NULL, the PREGs will have a canonical name
 *   as defined by Create_Preg().
 *
 * void AssignToPregExprPos(PREG_NUM pregNo, WN *block, WN *tree, TY_IDX ty,
 *                          SRCPOS srcpos, LOWER_ACTIONS actions)
 *
 * void AssignToPregExprTY(PREG_NUM pregNo, WN *block, WN *tree, TY_IDX type)
 *
 * void AssignToPregExpr(PREG_NUM pregNo, WN *block, WN *tree, TYPE_ID type)
 *
 *   All these functions assign the given expression to the preg specified.
 *   These function do the same as the Equivelent AssignPreg...() functions
 *   but for an available preg.
 *
 * 
 * LEAF WHIRL Tree Support
 * =======================
 *
 * LEAF Make_Leaf(WN *block, WN *tree, TYPE_ID type)
 *
 *   Make an arbitrary expression tree into a leaf.
 *   If the expression is an integer or floating point constant
 *   no transformation is made. However, other expressions are stored
 *   into a PREG.
 *
 *   Make_Leaf is used in place of AssignExpr when performing a sort
 *   of "poor man's" CSE, and you want to avoid creating unnecessary
 *   PREGs for constants (which can also thwart the simplifier).
 *
 * WN *Load_Leaf(const LEAF &leaf)
 *
 *   Generate whirl to load the value of a leaf expression created by
 *   Make_Leaf().
 *
 *
 * WHIRL Tree Queries
 * ==================
 *
 * BOOL Is_Intconst_Val(WN *tree)
 * INT64 Get_Intconst_Val(WN *tree)
 *
 *   The Is_Intconst_Val() function returns whether the given tree is an 
 *   INTCONST tree. It may use rematerialization information to  to retrieve
 *   the information more globally.
 *   The Get_Intconst_Val() function returns the effective literal value
 *   of the tree. It must be used only if Is_Intconst_Val() returned true.
 *
