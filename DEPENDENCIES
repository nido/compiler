# Revision file that references all dependencies of the project.
# A dependency is a 4-uplet: dependency_name,type,revision,location
# Depending on the dependency type, the revision and location may have
# different form.
# The following types are defined:
# svn: revision is a <branch>@<rev> svn revision identifier and location
#      is a reference svn <url>.
#      The command svn co -r <rev> <url>/<branch> should be sufficient to
#      retrieve all sources of the dependency.
#
# file: revision is the <file> name without directory specification.
#       location is the <directory> path of the dependency.
#       The path <directory>/<file> should be sufficient to identify the
#       dependency source uniquely.
